# Basic
This repo forked from Berkeley-CS61B/skeleton-sp21 which is the starter code for UCB online data structure course CS61b in Spring 2021.
For more course information, you can refer to the course website at https://sp21.datastructur.es/index.html.

CS61b sp21 was well known from project2: gitlet, which implement a small basic version control system git.
I totally recommend you to start with lab6 before the project2. Lab6 will lead you to work out gitlet project more easily
if you are new to java or executing line command in terminal.


# Note
## Lab6
Lab6 website: https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/lab/lab6/lab6#tips-faqs-misconceptions.
In this lab, you will
1. Learn how to compile a Java source code to Java byte code which can be executed by a machine.
2. Learn how to serialize a Java object to local file system, or deserialize from local file to Java object.
3. Learn how to deal with your local file system with java utility file function.
4. Learn the procedure of reading spec firstly, and then implement the skeleton code, and pass all test script by make file to verify your code is correct finally.
